# WebGL Developer test

As for the scope of the test, a full screen webgl application should be presented which should contain the following functionalities:

* A Solid color cube on the center of the screen
* Posibility to rotate the cube on it’s own position
* Posibility to double click the cube and randomly change the color
* Posibility to double click outside the cube and restore the original color

A pull request should be submited to this repository with the instructions to run the project. There’s no requirements on what type of technology or stack should be used, nor about the process to get the project working or its complexity. Only the 4 points mentioned before will be evaluated. 

For simplicity we have also included a dist folder which contains a simple setup that you can (optionally) use to work on your project. To get the dist folder working, use a terminal, navigate to that folder and run 'npm start'. Is a requiriment to have NodeJS and NPM installed for this option.

*For this purpose is required not to use a library such as Three.js, and instead to code pure Javascript and webgl with the simplest implementation.* Using third party code, such as already created algorithms on the web, books, blogs, or any type of resource is allowed. 

On the library folder you will find a useful library that’s worth checking ;)!
